# odin-etch-a-sketch

Project: Etch-a-Sketch
This is an interactive Etch-a-Sketch web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of the Odin Project curriculum. Users can draw on a grid by hovering over it with their mouse, mimicking the classic Etch-a-Sketch experience. The grid size can be customized, and the drawing color changes dynamically based on user interactions.

Features include:

-Customizable grid size for different levels of detail.
-Dynamic color changes when hovering over grid cells.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event listeners, and CSS flex layout.
